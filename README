You can find all inormation in the PDF: iam_tutorial_s19_190212

*******
KNOWN BUGS: 
* resetting the database with the burgermenu does not reload the listview, so there is no visual confirmation of the action
* EditviewViewController(53): items do not have a mediaType or a contentType. The if-else statement in the app.html (42 and 77) will fail and show an empty screen, therefor they have been outcommented.
